    IPv4 was developed in the early ’70s to facilitate communication and information
    sharing between government researchers and academics in the United States. At
    the time, the system was closed with a limited number of access points, and consequently
    the developers didn’t envision requirements such as security or quality of service.
    To its credit, IPv4 has survived for over 30 years and has been an integral part
    of the Internet revolution. But even the most cleverly designed systems age and
    eventually become obsolete. This is certainly the case for IPv4\. Today’s networking
    requirements extend far beyond support for web pages and email. Explosive growth
    in network device diversity and mobile communications, along with global adoption
    of networking technologies, new services, and social networks, are overwhelming
    IPv4 and have driven the development of a next-generation Internet Protocol.

    and using IPv4\. Proven and established mechanisms have been retained, known limitations
    have been discarded, and scalability and flexibility have been extended. IPv6
    is a protocol designed to handle the growth rate of the Internet and to cope with
    the demanding requirements on services, mobility, and end-to-end security.

    Internet Protocol (IP) in one day in 1983, IP was not the mature protocol that
    we know today. Many of the well-known and commonly used extensions were developed
    in subsequent years to meet the growing requirements of the Internet. In comparison,
    hardware vendors and operating system providers have been supporting IPv6 since
    1995 when it became a Draft Standard. In the decade since then, those implementations
    have matured, and IPv6 support has spread beyond the basic network infrastructure
    and will continue to be extended.

    for its network prefix, it can get one or more network prefixes from an IPv6 router
    on its link. Using this prefix information, it can autoconfigure for one or more
    valid global IP addresses by using either its MAC identifier or a private random
    number to build a unique IP address. In the IPv4 world, we have to assign a unique
    IP address to every device, either by manual configuration or by using DHCP. SLAAC
    should make the lives of network managers easier and save substantial cost in
    maintaining IP networks. Furthermore, if we imagine the number of devices we may
    have in our homes that will need an IP address in the future, this feature becomes
    indispensable. Imagine reconfiguring your DHCP server at home when you buy a new
    television! Stateless Address Autoconfiguration also allows for easy connection

    the IPv4 address space, it could be used much more effectively, but this process
    is not possible, and a global reallocation and renumbering is simply not practical.
    In addition to that it would not buy much, as even 4.3 billion addresses would
    not suffice for long at the current growth rate. We have to take into account

    addresses to the public address(es). NATs were introduced as a short-term fix
    for solving the address space limitations with IPv4, since IPv6 was not ready
    yet (refer to RFC 1631; the original NAT specification was obsoleted by RFC 3022
    in 2001). NATs have become pretty common in IPv4 networks, but they create serious
    disadvantages in management and operation: in order to do the address mapping,
    NATs modify end node addresses in the IP header. Very often, Application Level
    Gateways (ALG) are used in conjunction with NAT to provide application-level transparency.
    There is a long list of protocols and applications that create problems when used
    in a NAT environment. IPsec and peer-to-peer applications are two well-known examples.
    Another known issue with NAT is the overlapping of private address space when
    merging networks, which requires either the renumbering of one of the networks

    and business opportunities for vendors and service providers alike. The first-mover
    opportunities are substantial, as are the opportunities to extend current product
    life cycles by refreshing their technology with IPv6\. On the other hand, it means
    that organizations and users will require such services in the mid-term. It is
    therefore advisable to integrate the new protocol carefully and in a nondisruptive
    manner, by taking one step at a time to prepare the infrastructure for these new
    services. This protects you from having to introduce a business-critical application

- en: This was a concern of many people back in 2006 when we published the second
    edition of this book. Now in 2014 this is not true anymore. Many ISPs and organizations
    are deploying IPv6, vendors are getting up to speed, and the working groups have
    developed and optimized mechanisms that help with the integration. There is no
    technical reason not to do IPv6.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There will certainly be costs associated with adopting IPv6\. In many cases,
    newer networks will find that the level of IPv6 support in their current infrastructure
    is actually high. Regardless, the transition will necessitate some hardware and
    software costs. Organizations will need to create new designs, review current
    concepts, train their IT staff, and may need to seek outside expertise in order
    to take full advantage of IPv6.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, the cost savings associated with IPv6 are becoming easier to define.
    Networks based on IPv4 are becoming increasingly more complex. New IT services
    such as VoIP, instant messaging, video teleconferencing, IPTV, and unified communications
    are adding layers of middleware and complexity. Merging organizations or those
    conducting B2B transactions are implementing NAT overlap solutions that have high
    management costs and are difficult to troubleshoot. And a growing market of mobile
    devices and network appliances requires robust access models that are expensive
    and difficult to implement in an IPv4 world. In all of these cases, IPv6 presents
    a cleaner and more cost-effective model in the long run than IPv4 can provide.
    And the fact is that an investment in IPv4 is an investment in an end-of-life
    technology, while an investment in IPv6 is an investment in the future technology.

    Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, administrators will have a choice about their
    level of control. DHCPv6 as defined in RFC 3315 has been extended to support two
    general modes of operation, Stateful and Stateless. Stateful mode is what those
    who currently utilize DHCP (for IPv4) are familiar with, in which a node (DHCP
    client) requests an IP address and configuration options dynamically from a DHCP
    server. DHCPv6 also offers a Stateless mode in which DHCPv6 clients simply request
    configuration options from a DHCPv6 server and use other means, such as Stateless
    Address Autoconfiguration, to obtain an IPv6 address.

- en: You do not have to wait for your ISP to use IPv6 in your corporate or private
    network. If you want to connect to the global IPv6 Internet, you can use one of
    the transition mechanisms and tunnel your IPv6 packets over the IPv4 infrastructure
    of your ISP. This may be doable for smaller organizations. On the other hand,
    at the time of writing in 2014, you could expect a large ISP targeting enterprise
    customers to support IPv6\. And this should be your standard requirement in any
    renewal of contract and SLAs (Service Level Agreements). If your ISP does not
    provide IPv6 services, consider finding a new provider.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The transition mechanisms make it possible to use IPv6 where appropriate without
    dictating an order of upgrade. Usually for the backbone it is advisable to wait
    for the regular life cycle, when hardware needs to be exchanged anyway. Make sure
    to choose hardware that supports performance IPv6 routing. In the meantime, you
    can tunnel your IPv6 packets over the IPv4 backbone. Networks that use MPLS have
    an easy way to tunnel IPv6 packets over their IPv4 MPLS backbone. Read more about
    it in [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Transition Technologies"). More and more
    organizations are considering migrating their backbone and data centers to IPv6
    only with the next refresh or redesign cycle, because it substantially reduces
    operational cost. In this scenario we will start to tunnel IPv4 packets over IPv6
    backbones. IPv4 as a service is the new keyword.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The effort necessary to port applications to run over IPv6 is often much lower
    than expected. If an application is well written, it may simply run over IPv6
    without modification. Instead of assuming that it won’t work, test it to find
    out. For applications that need modifications that are not yet available, or for
    applications in which porting does not make sense, there are mechanisms available
    that support IPv4 applications in IPv6 networks and IPv6 applications in IPv4
    networks. Alternatively, you can run a dual-stack network, in which you use IPv4
    to access IPv4 applications and IPv6 to access IPv6 applications. In any case
    it is recommendable for enterprise customers to start the planning process early
    and provide good labs for the application teams to test their applications before
    there is time pressure.

    IPv6 today. But ignoring IPv6 for this reason is a perspective that assumes that
    your network stands completely isolated from the rest of the world, including
    your vendors, partners, and customers. IPv6 adoption is further along in Asia
    and Europe than in the United States, so even though you may have adequate address
    space for your operations in Denver, interconnecting with a partner organization
    in Tokyo may eventually become complicated if you do not support IPv6\. Plus,
    the assumption that IPv6 is about address space only doesn’t account for the advanced
    features that IPv6 brings to the table.

    IPv6 will slowly and gradually grow into our networks and the Internet. Taking
    a step-by-step approach to IPv6 may be the most cost-efficient way to integrate
    it, depending on your requirements. This method does not put your current infrastructure
    at risk or force you to exchange hardware or software before you are ready, and
    it allows you to become familiar with the protocol, to experiment, to learn, and
    to integrate what you’ve learned into your strategy.

    IPv4 addresses, ISPs that want to grow their customer base (and who does not want
    to do that?) make use of NAT-type mechanisms to extend their IPv4 address space.
    This includes CGN (Carrier Grade NAT), which means multiple customers share one
    single public IPv4 address and sit behind multiple layers of NAT.
