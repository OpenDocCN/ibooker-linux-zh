- en: It doesn’t matter how technical you are. You must continue learning throughout
    your career. And if you’re certified, many certifications require some continuing
    education units (CEUs) per year that you must document and submit to the certifying
    authority. But continuing your education involves more than just gathering certifications
    and collecting CEUs yearly to maintain those certifications. Continuing your education
    means expanding your horizons, learning something new, and enhancing your skills
    as a technologist.

- en: Often, the least expensive and most accessible training is that which your company
    produces, conducts, or hosts. I’m not referring to those annual refresher courses
    we must take to satisfy regulatory requirements. I’m referring to technical résumé-building
    classes that enhance your skills and knowledge. Internal training is either training
    that your company develops and delivers to employees or training that your company
    purchases and delivers on-premises. The delivery method depends on many factors,
    such as cost, instructor availability, time, and other logistical considerations.

  zh: 通常，最经济且最便捷的培训是公司自主开发、组织或主办的培训。我不是指我们必须参加以满足监管要求的年度复习课程。我指的是增强你技能和知识的技术简历构建课程。内部培训是指你的公司为员工开发并提供的培训，或者你的公司购买并在现场提供的培训。培训的交付方式取决于诸多因素，如成本、讲师可用性、时间和其他后勤考虑。
- en: There is a downside to internal training, and it’s that the training occurs
    on-site. Yes, one of the advantages is also a disadvantage. When you train at
    your local facility, you risk having users, colleagues, or your manager interrupt
    your training to have you fix something that will “only take a minute.” These
    disruptions and interruptions, while possibly necessary, are detrimental to your
    learning. You miss valuable information, demonstrations, and lessons that are
    often difficult to go back and pick up on your own. Personally, every on-premises
    class I’ve taken has been interrupted by support calls. My managers always reminded
    me that “training is a privilege” and “the job comes first” when I requested dedicated
    time for training. Be prepared for your training to be interrupted or even discontinued
    due to the requirements of your job.

  zh: 内部培训也存在一个弊端，那就是培训发生在现场。是的，其中一个优点也是一个缺点。当你在本地设施接受培训时，你可能会面临用户、同事或者你的经理来打断你的培训，让你去“只需要一分钟”的修复某些问题。这些中断和打扰，虽然可能是必要的，但对你的学习是有害的。你会错过宝贵的信息、演示和课程，这些内容往往很难自己回去再补习。就我个人而言，我参加的每一次现场课程都被支持电话打断过。当我请求专门的培训时间时，我的经理总是提醒我“培训是一种特权”和“工作是第一位”的理念。要做好培训可能会被打断甚至中止的准备，原因是你工作的要求。

- en: In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was an industry-wide effort to get
    technical people certified. However, many certification classes focused so much
    on teaching test answers that the learning was thin, and experienced technical
    folks considered certifications to have little value. Certification gets a bad
    rap because of this trend. Professionals offended by the number of freshly certified
    IT people then began to seek “higher level” certifications such as Cisco’s CCNA,
    CCNE, and others because they were perceived as legitimate, while those from other
    vendors weren’t.

- en: Fast-forward to present day, and IT certifications are still a thing; certain
    certifications are still considered more legitimate and worthy than others. A
    good example is the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP).
    This high-level certification has become so popular that an entire industry is
    now built around it. There are courses, study guides, boot camps, exam pass guarantees,
    cram sessions, hundreds of books, and more. When the industry becomes saturated
    with this certification, which was once very highly regarded, a new contender
    for everyone’s attention and money will rise up to replace it as the next big

    facts will help you with some questions, but you must read a scenario and decide

    being filled with people with degrees as diverse as psychology, English, and physics.
    Traditional colleges and universities didn’t support IT training until somewhat
    recently. Sure, a few colleges and universities offered management information
    systems (MIS) and computer information systems (CIS) degrees before that time.
