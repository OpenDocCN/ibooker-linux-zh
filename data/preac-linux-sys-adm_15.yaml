- en: Sure, our parents or grandparents might have started a job right out of high
    school or college, stayed with it for thirty or more years, and then retired,
    but that just isn’t the way careers go these days. And by *these days*, I mean
    for the past thirty years. In the various technology-related careers, it’s rare
    to find anyone in the same position with the same company for over five years.

  zh: 当然，我们的父母或祖父母可能从高中或大学毕业后就开始一份工作，一直做到三十年或更长时间，然后退休，但现在的职业生涯并不是这样发展的。而所谓的“现在”，我指的是过去三十年。在各种技术相关的职业中，很少有人能在同一公司同一个职位工作超过五年。
- en: From personal experience, I worked for EDS and HP for sixteen years, but I held
    several positions within each company during that time. Most of my jobs lasted
    from eighteen months to two-and-a-half years. It was prudent to switch roles often,
    although all were lateral moves, and I grew and learned in each one. I worked
    for the same manager three or more times during my tenure at EDS and HP. We both
    moved around inside the company and kept crossing paths. It seemed that managers
    moved around as often as regular employees. In those days of massive and continuous
    layoffs, it was wise to be a moving target.

  zh: 凭个人经验，我在EDS和HP工作了十六年，但在此期间在每家公司内担任了几个职位。我的大多数工作持续了十八个月到两年半。频繁转换角色是明智的，尽管所有的转换都是同级的，我在每一个角色中都有所成长和学习。在EDS和HP的任职期间，我同一个经理合作了三次或更多次。我们两个在公司内部频繁移动，总是交叉路径。在那些大规模连续裁员的日子里，像是一个活动靶子是明智的选择。
- en: These days, career moves aren’t seen as unfavorable. One recruiter told me that
    some managers and companies view a technical person who doesn’t make a move every
    eighteen to twenty-four months as less desirable as a potential candidate. I’m
    unconvinced that this is true. There’s something to be said for someone stable
    enough to stay put for a few years and become competent in every aspect of their
    job. But you will, at some point, find yourself looking for a new job in system
    administration. This chapter explores the various ways to find employment, upgrade
    your job, and go after those highly desirable “dream” positions.

    The desire for more money, or autonomy, leads you to conclude you can do it better,
    faster, or cheaper yourself. Or, maybe the thought of “being your own boss” appeals
    to you. For system administrators, being in business for yourself points to consulting,
    teaching, or freelancing. In all cases, it means directly selling your skills
    to companies. Not to be discouraging, but there are some things you need to know
    before you quit your job and embark on this new adventure.

- en: The primary reality you must face as an entrepreneur is that you are never your
    own boss. Every customer is your boss. When you work in a company, you generally
    have one manager to whom you report. Not so when you work for yourself. Your job
    now is to attract new customers and retain your current customers. You don’t get
    to call in sick when you feel under the weather, you don’t get to take a lot of
    time off for vacation, and your benefits are entirely your responsibility. This
    is to say, running a business is hard work.

  zh: 作为企业家，你必须面对的主要现实是，你从不是自己的老板。每一个客户都是你的老板。在公司工作时，通常你只有一个上级经理向其汇报。但是当你为自己工作时，情况就不同了。你现在的工作是吸引新客户并保持现有客户。当你感觉身体不适时，你不能请病假；你不能因度假而休息很长时间；你的福利完全由你自己负责。这就是说，经营一家企业是一项艰苦的工作。
- en: If these realities of self-employment don’t deter your interest, and you do
    decide to start your own business, one of your first steps should be to acquire
    insurance to protect yourself. Some insurance companies sell errors and omissions
    (E&O) insurance or some other indemnification policy to protect you against fraud,
    mistakes, and unhappy customers. Many community colleges offer business startup
    classes or small business management courses that you can take to test your venture’s
    efficacy.

    Dealing with vacations, sick leave, mistakes, customer care, and coworker interaction
    are all part of employee management. I advise you to state your expectations verbally
    and in writing before an employee begins work. You may do this via an employee
    handbook, one-on-one meetings, or other written and verbal communication forms.
    You should also have periodic meetings to give feedback on employee performance.
    Set up monthly or biweekly meetings to discuss expectations, performance, and
    employee issues. The number one complaint among employees is lack of communication.
    Don’t let it happen on your watch if you’ve been there yourself.

- en: You’ll also have to manage payroll, taxes, and employee benefits. Engage a bookkeeping

    than employees, but you don’t manage vacations, comp time, bonuses, sick leave,

- en: The primary problem with contract labor is that you have no control over their
    time, and control is the determining factor of whether someone is an employee
    or a contractor. Use caution when dictating working parameters so you don’t cross
    the contractor/employee line. Get the advice of an attorney or tax accountant
    for rules governing contractors versus employees. Having contractors reclassified
    as employees by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is expensive and detrimental
    to your business. Always engage professional advice for this aspect of your business.

    employees or contractors.

- en: As you can see, operating a business isn’t as simple as printing business cards

- en: I believe that many sysadmins, myself included, think that managers don’t understand
    what we do but realize that we’re an essential part of the organization. We are
    the *doers* of the org chart. A senior manager once told me (and I’m quoting here),
    “I don’t *do* anything, but I get things done.” I’m sure he saw my eyebrows raise
    as if to say, “Yeah, I know. We all know.” He didn’t respond to my unsubtle reaction
    to his statement. He did have a point, though. The issue was that he wasn’t employed
    to push buttons, pull levers, or reboot computers, but he was in a place to ensure
    someone pulled those levers and pushed those buttons. You see, management is a
    different perspective. Managers carry orders from above and get credit for their
    direct reports. The managers, in turn, are supposed to reward their achievers.

- en: Being a manager isn’t easy. A lot of corporate responsibility rests on your
    shoulders, but the real rewards are dispersed above your pay grade for your work
    via direct reports. Managers have to “play politics,” which means they must strike
    a balance between the people on the front lines, such as the help desk technicians,
    desktop technicians, sysadmins, network admins, database administrators, and so
    on. These direct reports may be overworked, disgruntled, and underappreciated.
    At the same time, your manager’s managers have no clue what the people at the
    bottom of the food chain do to keep the wheels of business turning.

    people management, corporate culture, and your organization from the top down.
    If you’re a parent, how did you learn to be one? Perhaps from observing your parents.

    you’re in the office and your meetings are “in person.” You don’t have to look
    like you’re going to a posh affair, but you must look presentable and professional.

    I know it’s hard to do, but the person looking at you while speaking would rather
    see you looking back at them rather than peering to one side. You should avoid
    distractions while you’re on a business call. Perhaps you’ve seen the video of
    the news anchor broadcasting from home when his children break into his room.
    The video is funny, and most people are forgiving, but it does have the effect

    jokes, and colloquialisms don’t always have the same effect in email as in spoken
    conversation because the recipient can’t read facial expressions or hear voice
    inflections that clue them into alternative meanings. You should avoid colloquialisms

- en: Writing letters of resignation is often one of the hardest things you’ll do
    in your career. My emotions have run the gamut when writing resignation letters,
    and I’ve experienced joy, anger, depression, and fear. It’s often hard to leave
    a job you love, and it’s also hard to leave one where you’ve gained friends and
    comfort. You must take extra precautions when resigning from a position you don’t
    like, and restraint is vital.
